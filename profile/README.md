# Welcome

We are the Legislation Services team at The National Archives. Along with our partners, we are responsible for:

 * Lawmaker, a service to help draft and manage UK and Scottish legislation 
 * [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/), a service that makes the UK statute book (and its metadata) available freely to all to read and reuse

This GitHub page hosts code we use to deliver these services, as well as documentation relating to our APIs and data models.

To get in touch about the services we provide or the contents of this GitHub page, please contact:

 * data.legislation@nationalarchives.gov.uk, for queries specifically relating to legislation data and code
 * legislation@nationalarchives.gov.uk, for other queries relating to legislation
